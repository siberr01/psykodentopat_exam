This is a R Markdown report for the group exam in RMED901A for the group psykodentopat. The group consists of Hilde Kollsete Gjelberg, Ingrid Eline Holm, and Simen Berrefjord.

The report includes all the steps we have conducted throughout the course related to the exam data (i.e., exploration, tidying, visualization, and statistical analyses).

## Data exploration


## Tidying of data


## Visualization
The next part of our project concerned visualization. We used the joined_exam_data_2025-09-09.txt.   
Our task was to create plots to answer the following questions: 

**1. Are there any correlated measurements?**  

To explore potential relationships between the variables, we created a correlation matrix.  
The `patient_id` collumn was excluded because it is just an identifier and does not carry meaningful information for correlation analysis.  
```{r reading data, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)
joined_exam_data <- read_delim(here("data","joined_exam_data_2025-09-09.txt"))

```

```{r warning = FALSE}
joined_exam_data %>%
  select(-patient_id) %>% 
  GGally::ggcorr()
```
  
This correlation matrix demonstrates a strong positive correlation between `swallowPain` and `throatPain`.`BMI` and `age` appears to have a weak positive correlation.  
  
  
**2.  Does the age distribution depend on treatmeant-group?**  
To investigate whether age distribution differs between treatment groups, we created a density plot stratified by treatment.  

```{r ggplot patient age treatment, include=FALSE}
ggplot <- ggplot(joined_exam_data, aes(x = age, fill = treat)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  theme_gray() +
  labs(title = "Age distribution by treatment",
       x = "Patient age",
       fill = "Treatment:") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "PuOr")
```
 
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(joined_exam_data, aes(x = age, fill = treat)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Age distribution by treatment",
       x = "Patient age",
       fill = "Treatment:")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot
```
  
This density-plot demonstrates that the age distributions in the two treatment groups are similar, and age distribution does not seem to depend on treatment. There may be a mild tendency for Licorice-treated patients to be older on average, based on the higher peak in the 65â€“75 age range.  

**Does the age distribution of the patients depend on their sex?**
  
To investigate whether age distribution depend on sex, we created a density plot stratified by `gender`.   

```{r ggplot age gender, include=FALSE}
density_age_distribution_by_gender <- ggplot(joined_exam_data, 
                                          aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Age distribution by gender", 
       x = "Patient age", 
       fill = "Gender") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Pastel2")
density_age_distribution_by_gender
```
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(joined_exam_data, aes(x = age, fill = gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Age distribution by gender", 
       x = "Patient age", 
       fill = "Gender")
```
```{r, echo =FALSE}
density_age_distribution_by_gender
```

This density-plot demonstrates that the age distribution does not strongly depend on gender seeing as the density curves overlap substantially.  
    
    
**Does the preoperative pain change with age of the patients?**  

```{r}
ggplot(joined_exam_data, aes(x = age, fill = preOp_pain)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(
    x = "Age",
    y = "Density"                 
  )
```
  
This density-plot can indicate difference in age in those experiencing preoperative pain and not. However, only two patients in the dataset reported pre-operative pain.The density curve for the "yes" group therefore represents very few observations and should be interpreted with caution. This explains why the curve looks irregular compared to the "no" group.  
  
To illustrate it in a more approriate way, we made a dotplot. 
```{r}
ggplot(joined_exam_data, aes(x = preOp_pain, y = age)) +
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center", dotsize = 0.8,
               binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Age by Pre-Op Pain Status",
       x = "Pre-Op Pain",
       y = "Age") +
  theme_minimal()
```


The dotplot illustrates that the data is highly imbalanced, and the datamaterial is too limited to answer the question.   



## Statistical analyses
```{r load data, include=FALSE}
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(broom)
library(lme4)
library(broom.mixed)

# Load data
joined_exam_data <- read_delim(here("data","joined_exam_data_2025-09-09.txt"))

# Mutate from character to factor
joined_exam_data <- joined_exam_data %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
```

In this section, we investigate three main questions:

  1. Does the treatment depend on the preoperative smoking?
  2. Does the treatment depend on the gender of the patient?  
  3. According to the data, was the treatment with licorice gargle reducing the risk of post operative throat pain?

The variables and their respective levels involved in these questions are:

- `smoking`: current, past, never
- `gender`: Male, Female  
- `treat`: Licorice, Sugar
- `time`: pacu30min, pacu90min, postOp4hour, pod1am
- `throatPain`: Assessed on a 11-point Likert scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain)

### Does the treatment depend on the preoperative smoking?
In order to answer this, we first created a table for visual inspection of how `smoking` status was distributed across `treat`. 

```{r treatment-smoking table, echo=TRUE}
# Create dataset with one row per participant
patient_level_data <- joined_exam_data %>% 
  distinct(patient_id, treat, smoking, gender, age, BMI)

# Table of treatment (rows) by smoking (columns) - one per patient
table(patient_level_data$treat, patient_level_data$smoking) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Treatment Distribution by Smoking Status",
    col.names = c("Current", "Never", "Past")
  )
```
On face value, it seems as though the distribution of `smoking` status is evenly distributed between the `treat` conditions. However, we can also test this using a chi-squared test!

```{r chi-squared test treat-smoking, echo=TRUE}
chisq.test(table(patient_level_data$treat, patient_level_data$smoking)) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    digits = 3,
    col.names = c("Chi-square", "p-value", "df", "Method"),
    caption = "Association between Treatment and Smoking Status"
  )
```
The chi-squared statistic was 0.009 (p = 0.995), showing that the treatment is not dependent of smoking status.

### Does the treatment depend on the gender of the patient?
Similary to the previous analysis, we can conduct a chi-squared test of `treat` and `gender`. 

```{r table treat-gender, echo=TRUE}
## Table of treatment (rows) by gender (columns) - one per patient
table(patient_level_data$treat, patient_level_data$gender) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    caption = "Treatment Distribution by Gender",
    col.names = c("Female", "Male")
  )
```

The distribution of `gender` by received `treat` seems even, but we also wish to test this using a chi-squared test.

```{r chi-square treat-gender, echo=TRUE}
chisq_treat_gender_result <- chisq.test(table(patient_level_data$treat, patient_level_data$gender)) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  rename(
    chi_square = statistic,
    degrees_of_freedom = parameter
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    digits = 3,
    col.names = c("Chi-square", "p-value", "df", "Method"),
    caption = "Association between Treatment and Gender"
  )

chisq_treat_gender_result
```
This chi-squared test was insignificant (p = 0.631), indicating that the groups are evenly distributed across `treat` and `gender`.

### Was the treatment with licorice gargle reducing the risk of post operative throat pain?

We have three variables of interest to answer this question:

- `treat`: Licorice or Sugar. 
- `throatPain`: Assessed on a 11-point Likert scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain).
- `time`: Post operative throat pain was assessed at 4 hours after operation and the first morning after operation. 

#### A simple approach
We investigated if the patients reported different pain scores at postOp4hour.

First, we created a histogram to see the distribution of throatPain scores at postOp4hour.

```{r pain distribution, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Filter to 4-hour timepoint only
postOp4h_data <- joined_exam_data %>% 
  filter(time == "postOp4hour")

# Create plot
ggplot(postOp4h_data, aes(x = throatPain)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  facet_wrap(~treat) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of throatPain at postOp4hour")
```
The pain values are highly skewed, with many patients reporting 0 throatPain in both treatment conditions. Due to the pain scores not being normally distributed, a Wilcoxon rank sum test is appropriate.

```{r wilcox throatPain-postOp4hour, echo=TRUE}
# Descriptive statistics by treatment
postOp4h_data %>% 
  group_by(treat) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_pain = mean(throatPain, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_pain = median(throatPain, na.rm = TRUE),
    prop_no_pain = mean(throatPain == 0, na.rm = TRUE),
    n = n()
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    digits = 3,
    caption = "Throat Pain at 4 Hours Post-Operation by Treatment"
  )

# Wilcoxon rank sum test
wilcox.test(throatPain ~ treat, data = postOp4h_data) %>% 
  tidy() %>% 
  knitr::kable(
    digits = 4,
    col.names = c("Statistic", "p-value", "Method", "Alternative"),
    caption = "Wilcoxon Test: Treatment Effect at 4 Hours"
  )
```

At 4 hours post-operation, patients in the licorice group experienced lower throat pain compared to the sugar group. The licorice group had a mean pain score of 0.35 (median = 0), while the sugar group had a mean pain score of 0.91 (median = 0). Notably, 79.5% of patients receiving licorice gargle reported no throat pain, compared to 55.2% in the sugar group. The Wilcoxon rank sum test showed a statistically significant difference in throat pain scores between treatment groups (W = 5109.5, p = 0.0001).

#### A more complex approach
In order to investigate if licorice reduced the risk of post operative throat pain, we can conduct a regression analysis of how `treat` affects `throatPain` over `time`.

```{r lmm throatpain-time-treat, echo=TRUE}
# Mixed effects model with all timepoints
throat_model <- lmer(throatPain ~ treat * time + (1|patient_id), 
                     data = joined_exam_data)

# Tidy results focusing on treatment effects
tidy(throat_model, effects = "fixed") %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3, caption = "Mixed effects model results") 

# Full model summary
summary(throat_model)
```
The model showed a significant main effect of treatment (Î² = 0.752, t = 5.496), indicating that sugar treatment increases throat pain by approximately 0.75 points compared to licorice across all time points.

We can also visualize this using ggplot2:

```{r visualizing treat-time-throatPain, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
# Ensure correct time order
joined_exam_data$time <- factor(joined_exam_data$time, 
                               levels = c("pacu30min", "pacu90min", "postOp4hour", "pod1am"))

# Plot
joined_exam_data %>% 
  group_by(treat, time) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_pain = mean(throatPain, na.rm = TRUE),
    se_pain = sd(throatPain, na.rm = TRUE) / sqrt(n()),
    .groups = "drop"
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = mean_pain, color = treat, group = treat)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 0.5) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = mean_pain - se_pain, ymax = mean_pain + se_pain), 
                width = 0.1) +
  labs(
    x = "Time point",
    y = "Throat pain score (mean)",
    color = "Treatment",
    title = "Throat pain over time by treatment"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```
